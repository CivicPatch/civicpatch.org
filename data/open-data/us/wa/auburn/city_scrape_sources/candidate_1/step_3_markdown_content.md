Nancy Backus, Auburn's first female mayor since its 1891 incorporation, began her mayoral term in 2014. Prior, she spent a decade as an Auburn city councilmember and 25 years as a financial manager at Boeing. Holding an accounting degree, she's a dedicated wife and mother to a high-achieving daughter who graduated from Evergreen State College.

Committed to community service and women's empowerment, Backus received awards like Soroptimist International's Women Helping Women (2002), Miss Auburn Scholarship Program's Lifetime Achievement (2013), and the 2014 BPW Woman of Achievement. Her accolades also include Boeing's BCFP Manager of the Year (2011) and the AMA Dr. Nathan Davis Award for Outstanding Government Service.

Known for regional consensus-building, Backus co-convened One Table with King County Executive Dow Constantine and former Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan. One Table unites various stakeholders to address homelessness and housing affordability issues.

She's active on boards and committees advocating for Auburn's interests, including:

 *  __All Home Coordinating Board__ Member 
 *  __Association of Washington Cities__   

Large City Advisory Committee  

Legislative Committee
 *  __Cities & Schools__    

Member
 *  __Greater Seattle Partners__
