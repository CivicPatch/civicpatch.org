## About Us

Everett City Council is the city's governing body. Council comprises seven non-partisan Councilmembers – two at-large and five district representatives –who are elected to serve four-year terms advocating for Everett residents. 

Together, the Mayor and Councilmembers establish policies, determine goals, objectives and direction for city services and adopt annual operating budgets for all City of Everett departments.

## Mission Statement

As a matter of open government and transparency, the Everett City Council strives to engage the public in a civil and democratic process. As the policy-setting and oversight body for the City, the design of the City's democracy as outlined in the Charter is that the legislative branch sets the policy, and the administrative branch carries it out.
