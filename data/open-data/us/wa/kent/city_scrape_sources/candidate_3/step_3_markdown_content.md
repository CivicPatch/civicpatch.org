***

The seven-member Kent City Council is the legislative body for the City of Kent, Washington. Besides establishing policies and regulations, the Council approves financial expenditures and the City's biennial budget.

Elected by Kent voters during odd-numbered years, Kent City Councilmembers serve four-year terms. They are non-partisan, meaning they do not represent political parties. They are elected at-large, meaning they do not represent a specific geographical area within the City of Kent. All Councilmembers receive a monthly salary, plus reimbursement for any expenses.
