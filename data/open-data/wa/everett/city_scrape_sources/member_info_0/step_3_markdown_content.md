 [*Learn about the city priorities introduced by Mayor Franklin*](https://everettwa.gov/2459).

Mayor Cassie Franklin took office on Jan. 1, 2018, becoming the first elected female mayor of the City of Everett, Washington.

As mayor, Franklin’s top priorities are violence prevention, behavioral health and creating a prosperous city. Her focus is to ensure the City’s ongoing financial wellbeing and the success of all of Everett’s businesses. Franklin is committed to open, transparent government, making sure the City’s workforce and volunteers are reflective of Everett’s diverse community, increasing public safety and finding appropriate and effective ways to respond to street-level issues and addiction.

Franklin has issued several mayoral directives to prioritize key areas including violent crime; housing for all; behavioral health; climate action; economic development; community engagement; the City’s structural budget deficit; and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. 

Franklin is a local and regional leader. She founded and co-chairs the bi-partisan group, Mayors and Business leaders for Public Safety, serves on the Puget Sound Regional Council, the Economic Alliance Snohomish County Board of Trustees, the Executive Council of the Greater Seattle Partners and on the Sound Transit Board of Directors. She also launched a Mayor’s Drug Crisis Task Force. 

Franklin was elected to the Everett City Council in 2015 and served as the council’s vice president in 2017. During her time on council, she also chaired the City’s Lodging Tax Advisory Board and the council’s Public Safety Committee. In 2016, she was appointed to the Human Development Federal Advocacy Committee for the National League of Cities.

From 2011-2017, Franklin was CEO of Cocoon House, a nonprofit that provides outreach and housing for homeless and at-risk young people. From that position, she collaborated with leaders across the region to develop best practices for serving at-risk youth and preventing homelessness. Under her guidance, the organization became a regional leader and is now nationally recognized for its innovative solutions to homelessness.

An active community volunteer, Franklin is a past president of the South Everett Mukilteo Rotary Club and has served on a variety of local boards.

Franklin holds a bachelor’s Degree from Lewis and Clark College in Portland, OR, and completed her graduate studies program in psychology at the University of Munich in Germany, specializing in family systems therapy.
