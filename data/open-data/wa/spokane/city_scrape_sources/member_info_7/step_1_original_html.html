                                <p>As Council President Betsy Wilkerson’s Legislative Assistant, Mark Carlos is proud to be the first Man of Color to hold the position on Council and aims to help her bring leadership opportunities to not only Communities of Color but those in the parts of Spokane that have felt left out and underrepresented. He is passionate about regional issues, Equitable Access to Broadband, and engaging working class youth and young adults who often find shift work to be a barrier to participating in the community.</p>
                                <p>Mark is a long time community organizer, first serving in student government starting in middle school and serving with his church youth group where he eventually became an Assistant Youth Minister. He continued his advocacy work as part of the Associated Student Government at Spokane Falls Community College through his various roles as Club Liaison, Legislative &amp; Finance Director, and the Eastern Washington Regional Representative for the Washington Community &amp; Technical Colleges Student Association (WACTCSA). Among his proudest achievements at SFCC are hosting the first on-campus ballot collection drive, reviving the historic Red Nations Club, and reorganizing the LGBTQ+ Alliance. He also orchestrated The Week of the Woman, A Women's Suffrage Centennial Celebration which featured Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, and the diverse female leaders that then-served at SFCC in the administration, the faculty and in Student Organizations. Through campus workshops it also highlighted the work yet to be done when it comes to women, access and positions of power.</p>
                                <p>When he finds time Mark likes to go out with friends, attempt his hand at gardening, try new recipes, volunteer at his church and spend time with his family. Feel free to say hi when you see him out serving in the community, or send him an email so he can connect you with the Council President. They are both more than happy to help the residents of this wonderful city we get to call home!</p>
