I'm enormously grateful for the honor of serving as your new citywide Councilmember. I ran on a platform of change and a vision of hope. With a different kind of leadership and a commitment to working together, we can make progress on our biggest challenges and also improve the quality of life for all Seattleites. We have a fresh start with new leadership and I'm excited - and humbled - to get to work.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for this opportunity to serve you. Please keep in touch or reach out to my office if you'd like to connect.
