Hi, I’m Joy Hollingsworth, and I represent Seattle’s District 3, which includes Eastlake, Montlake, Madison Park, Madison Valley, Capitol Hill, First Hill, Portage Bay, Leschi, Madrona and the Central District.

I am a fourth-generation Seattleite, born and raised in the historic central district neighborhood. Our office is focused on the fundamental elements of essential government services that effect our day-to-day lives. Public Safety, Transportation, Housing, local businesses, Parks, libraries and community centers create vibrant neighborhoods and keeps our community connected.

City council is often the front porch of city government, and our office is committed to serving all neighborhoods block by block focused on outcomes.

### Our Mission

To deliver transparent and accessible governance by upholding the core services of safety, economic vitality, environmental sustainability, Sound Infrastructure, and resources.

### Our Values

Community, Culture and Commerce.

We value transformational relationships, and I welcome your connection. Reach me and my team by emailing  [Joy.Hollingsworth@seattle.gov](mailto:Joy.Hollingsworth@seattle.gov%20)  or by calling 206-684-8803

### Joy Hollingsworth

Joy was born and raised in Seattle’s Central District, a neighborhood her family has called home since the 1940’s. The product of a long line of educators and civil rights leaders, Joy's mother spent her career connecting vulnerable neighbors with housing options, while her father worked for equity in South Seattle as a longtime Parks Department employee, and her grandmother, Dorothy Hollingsworth, was a fierce advocate for families and opportunity.
