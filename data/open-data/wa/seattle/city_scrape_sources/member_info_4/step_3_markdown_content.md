## Welcome!

I am honored to represent Seattle as your Councilmember for District 6, which includes Magnolia, Ballard, Phinney Ridge, Green Lake, Greenwood, Fremont and many other microneighborhoods. 

These are the communities where I was born and raised. I look forward to working with you to build our future together: a city that is safe, affordable, and full of opportunity for all. It is time for us to create bold solutions at the scale of the problems we are seeking to address. We live in a world-class City, and you deserve world-class services and amenities.  

Please reach out. I want to hear your ideas for our city’s future and how your local government can serve you. You can call, email, or, if you’re a District 6 resident, you can [sign up](https://outlook.office365.com/book/OfficeofCouncilmemberDanStraussOfficeHours@seattle.gov) for my weekly office hours.
