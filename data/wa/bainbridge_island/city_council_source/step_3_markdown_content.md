##  __Government Structure__ 

The City of Bainbridge Island is a non-charter code city with a council / manager form of government. The City Council members are elected officers, each of whom have been a registered voter and resident of the city for a period of at least one year preceding their election.

The responsibilities and authority of the city manager and the City Council are regulated by the [Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Section 35A.13](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35a.13).

The City Council is the legislative branch of city government. The City Council can set public policy in two major ways:

 1. By enacting ordinances during the year
 1. By establishing budgetary (taxing and spending) policies

Council duties also include defining the functions, powers and duties of city officers and employees.

## Council - Manager

Under the council - manager form of government, the members of the City Council choose a chair from among their number on a biennial basis. The chair has the title of mayor and presides at Council meetings. He or she also continues to have all the rights, privileges, and immunities of a member of the Council. The mayor is recognized as the head of the city for ceremonial purposes.

He or she has no regular administrative duties, but in time of public danger or emergency, if so authorized by ordinance, shall take command of the police, maintain law, and enforce order. The City Council also selects a mayor pro tem, to serve in the absence or temporary disability of the mayor. The mayor pro tem also presides over City Council study sessions.
