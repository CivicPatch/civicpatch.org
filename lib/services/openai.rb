        You are an expert data extractor. The following is #{truncated_geojson.length} of the features of a geojson file.
        Determine if the following content contains #{truncated_geojson.length} city council #{division_type}s.

        If available, determine the following properties strictly in YAML format:
        - has_division_data ("true" or "false" -- true if the data set has the city's #{division_type} info)
        - has_city_data ("true" or "false" -- true if based off the page url and the data, that the dataset is for #{city}, #{state})

      You are an expert data extractor.
      Extract the following properties from the provided content:

      For each council member (leave empty if not found):
        - council_members:
            - name
            - phone_number
            - image (Extract the image URL from the <img> tag's src attribute. This will always be a relative URL.)
            - email
            - website (Provide the absolute URL.)
              If no specific website is provided, leave this empty â€” do not default to the general city or council page.)

      For each city leader (e.g., mayors, city managers, etc. leave empty if not found):
        - city_leaders:
            - name
            - position (e.g., Mayor, City Manager, etc.)
            - phone_number
            - image (Same rules as above.)
            - email
            - website (Same rules as above.)

      Basic rules:
      - Youth council members are NOT city council members.
      - City council members and city leaders should all be human beings with a name and at least one piece of contact field.
      - If you find just a list of names, with at least a website or email, they are likely to be council members.
      - Output the results in YAML format. For any fields not provided in the content, return an empty string, except for 'name' which is required.
      - If you cannot find any relevant information, return the following YAML:
        - error: "No relevant information found"

      Example Output (YAML):
      ---

        - name: "Jane Smith"
